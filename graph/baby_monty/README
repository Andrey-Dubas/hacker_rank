Baby Monty is desperate to work at a new company, Manvar, which has released an open interview question:

    Given a tree of nodes, select any two nodes such that the distance between them is an even number. Count the possible number of unique selections based on the above statement.

Monty fears his algorithm is not correct; solve the problem so he can compare results.

Note: Two pairs are considered different if at least one node is different in both pairs.

Input Format

The first line contains , the number of test cases, and each test case spans several lines.
The first line of each test case is an integer, , the total number of nodes.
The subsequent lines each contain two space-separated vertices ( and ) connecting nodes in the tree.

Constraints:


Output Format
1 <= T <= 100
1 < N <= 10^4
1 <= X, Y <= N

For each test case, print a line with the number of pairs having even distance between them.
